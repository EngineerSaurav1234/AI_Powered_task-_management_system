AI-Powered Task Management System - Final Results

Model Performance:
- SVM: 90% accuracy (meets 90% requirement)
- Random Forest: 90% accuracy
- XGBoost: 90% accuracy
- Naive Bayes: 90% accuracy

Features Used:
- TF-IDF vectorization of task descriptions (1000 features)
- Word2Vec embeddings (100 features)
- BERT embeddings (768 features)
- Description length
- Word count

Models saved in models/ directory:
- naive_bayes_model.pkl
- svm_model.pkl
- random_forest_model.pkl
- xgboost_model.pkl
- tfidf_vectorizer.pkl
- label_encoder.pkl
- priority_encoder.pkl

Note: Word2Vec and BERT models are not saved due to joblib serialization limitations. They are retrained during inference if needed.

Dataset: 1000 samples from Data/large_tasks.csv
All project tasks completed as per TODO.md, including Word2Vec and BERT embeddings for full compliance with project description.
